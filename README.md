# Cloud-Hosted Notebook Data Manipulation

## Project Overview
I ingested and preformed EDA on the popular [Tianic dataset](https://github.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/raw/master/titanic.csv). I used Google Colab for this project and uploaded the corresponding .ipynb file to this repo. The link for the Colab Notebook is listed below for anyone to try out. I also included some of the generated plots down below.

## EDA Description
The initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involved creating fundamental plots to understand key aspects of the Titanic dataset. These plots included:

- A bar plot depicting the count of survivors, providing an overall view of survival outcomes.
- A bar plot displaying the distribution of passengers across different classes, giving insight into the class demographics.
- A grouped bar plot illustrating survival status based on passenger class, offering a comparison of survival rates among different classes.
- A histogram showcasing the age distribution of passengers, helping to understand the age demographics onboard.
- A histogram highlighting the survival distribution by age group, offering insights into how age affected survival outcomes.
- A bar plot indicating survival based on gender, providing a visual comparison of survival rates between males and females.
- A histogram representing the fare distribution, revealing insights into the range and distribution of ticket prices.
- A bar plot showing the relationship between embarked location and survival status, providing information about the survival rates by embarkation point.
- A unique violin plot was created to combine information about passenger class, age, and survival status. This plot provides a visually appealing representation of how these factors interact, using the width of each section to show the density of data points at different age levels.
- A bar plot was created providing a clear comparison of survival rates across different classes. Additionally, a grouped bar plot was generated to compare survival rates by gender within each class. Finally, a boxplot was used to compare fare distributions between survivors and non-survivors.

These tasks collectively provide a comprehensive exploration of the Titanic dataset, offering insights into factors affecting survival rates such as class, age, gender, and fare. The range of plots and analyses performed offer a well-rounded understanding of the dataset's characteristics and relationships between variables.
